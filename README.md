# *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*

*In this challenge, we will practice `CSS transitions` by adding animations to a static web page that serves as an online reader. Here are some features we will explore:*

- *`Sidebar Hover:`* *When you hover over the sidebar on the left, a menu opens to display the Table of Contents.*
- *`Word Definitions:`* *When you hover over a highlighted word in the text, a definition appears. Check the words “phosphorescent” and “locomotion.”*
- *`Semi-Transparent Buttons:`* *The semi-transparent buttons at the bottom of the page become opaque when you hover over them.*
- *`Link Color Change:`* *When you hover over a link, its color changes.*
